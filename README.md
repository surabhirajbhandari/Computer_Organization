Computer Systems & Architecture Projects

This repository contains a series of hands-on projects completed for the *Computer Organization (ECE 350)* course at Drexel University. These projects explore foundational computer architecture concepts—from digital logic gates to virtual machines—and demonstrate how low-level systems are built from the ground up.

## Projects Overview

- **Project1_Adders**: Implemented binary adders (half-adder, full-adder) using logic design to explore fundamental arithmetic circuits.
- **Project2_ALU**: Designed an Arithmetic Logic Unit capable of performing operations such as addition, negation, and bitwise logic.
- **Project3_Counter**: Developed a synchronous binary counter using sequential logic.
- **Project3_Memory**: Simulated RAM modules with dynamic read/write functionality and address decoding.
- **Project4_HackComputer**: Built a simulation of the Hack computer architecture, integrating CPU, ALU, and memory to execute binary programs.
- **Project5_Assembler**: Created a custom assembler to convert Hack assembly code into machine code.
- **Project6_VMtranslator_P1**: Developed the first phase of a Virtual Machine (VM) translator to convert stack-based commands into Hack assembly (arithmetic and memory operations).
- **Project7_VMtranslator_P2**: Extended the VM translator to include control flow, function calls, and return commands, fully simulating the VM-to-assembly translation pipeline.

## Key Concepts

- Digital Logic Design (gates, adders, counters)
- ALU and CPU architecture
- Memory systems and address decoding
- Machine-level instruction execution
- Stack-based Virtual Machine architecture
- Assembly and Binary translation
- Compiler and interpreter design fundamentals

## Technologies Used

- Python (Assembler & VM Translator)
- Hack Assembly Language
- Logic Simulation Tools (e.g., HDL Simulator from Nand2Tetris toolchain)

##  Course Context

These projects are inspired by the **Nand2Tetris** curriculum and were completed for Drexel University's Computer Organization course. The goal was to bridge theoretical computer science with hands-on system design by building a computer from the ground up.
